# EPPlus 5

## Announcement: new license model from version 5
EPPlus has from this new major version changed license from LGPL to [Polyform Noncommercial 1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/).

With the new license EPPlus is still free to use in some cases, but will require a commercial license to be used in a commercial business.

This is explained in more detail [here](https://www.epplussoftware.com/Home/LgplToPolyform).

Commercial licenses, which includes support, can be purchased at (https://www.epplussoftware.com/).

The source code of EPPlus has moved to a [new github repository](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus)

## LicenseContext parameter must be set
With the license change EPPlus has a new parameter that needs to be configured. If the LicenseContext is not set, EPPlus will throw a LicenseException (only in debug mode).

This is a simple configuration that can be set in a few alternative ways:

### 1. Via code
```csharp
// If you are a commercial business and have
// purchased commercial licenses use the static property
// LicenseContext of the ExcelPackage class :
ExcelPackage.LicenseContext = LicenseContext.Commercial;

// If you use EPPlus in a noncommercial context
// according to the Polyform Noncommercial license:
ExcelPackage.LicenseContext = LicenseContext.NonCommercial;

using(var package = new ExcelPackage(new FileInfo("MyWorkbook.xlsx")))
{

}
```
### 2. Via appSettings.json
```json
{
    {
    "EPPlus": {
        "ExcelPackage": {
            "LicenseContext": "Commercial" //The license context used
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### 3. Via app/web.config
```xml
<appSettings>
    <!--The license context used-->
    <add key="EPPlus:ExcelPackage.LicenseContext" value="NonCommercial" />
</appSettings>
```
### 4. Set the environment variable 'EPPlusLicenseContext'
This might be the easiest way of configuring this. Just as above, set the variable to Commercial or NonCommercial depending on your usage.

**Important!** The environment variable should be set at the user level.

## Using EPPlus on Non-Windows systems
To use EPPlus with .NET Core on Non-Windows systems, libgdiplus is required.

Homebrew on MacOS:  
`brew install mono-libgdiplus`

apt-get:  
`apt-get install libgdiplus`

## New features in EPPlus 5
EPPlus 5 comes with a set of new features, see (https://www.epplussoftware.com/Developers/Features)

## Breaking Changes
* The default behavior for the Worksheet collection base in .NET Framework has changed from 1 to 0. This is the same default behavior as in .NET core today.
* Pictures have changed the behavior as the oneCellAnchor tag is used instead of the twoCellAnchor tag with the editAs="oneCell".
* ...and more, see https://epplussoftware.com/docs/5.2/articles/breakingchanges.html

## Improved documentation
EPPlus 5 has new, separate sample projects for [.NET Core](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus.Sample.NetCore) and [.NET Framework](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus.Sample.NetFramework) respectively.
There is also an updated [developer wiki](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus/wiki). The work with improving the documentation will continue, feedback is highly appreciated!
